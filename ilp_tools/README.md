To run a quick check that solver dependencies, run the mock solver:

```shell
python mock_solver.py
```

To get started, open the `visualize_phase1.ipynb` notebook and run the code blocks.

Once you have all services set up and running (see READMEs in Performance Profiler and Request Distribution Service), you can test a provisioning with:

```shell
python run_live_ilp_demo.py
```
